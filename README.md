# Deep Learning Study Notes

This repository contains my study notes and code implementations while learning from the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) book.

## Overview
- Taking notes and implementing examples from d2l.ai
- Creating practical implementations to reinforce learning
- Documenting key concepts and insights

## Installation

```sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -b
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda create --name d2l python=3.9 -y

# create d2l
conda activate d2l

# install d2l by source
pip install .

# exit d2l
conda deactivate
```

## Structure
- Each chapter will have its own directory
- Code examples will be included alongside explanations
- Implementation exercises and solutions

## Resources
- Main resource: [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)
